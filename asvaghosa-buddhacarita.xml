         <editorialDecl>
            <p>The text of the Johnston edition was transliterated on the basis of a cursory
               reading; the typed input was compared with the edition by Cowell, partly as a routine
               of proof--reading, partly in order to be able to add variant readings from the older
               edition. (The conventions for inputting variants are described below.) Proof--reading
               and insertion of variants was done "manually" and I (Peter Schreiner) do not
               guarantee completeness. The additional passages in Cowell at the beginning of the
               poem were not transliterated completely, and the additional chapters at the end were
               not transliterated at all.</p>

            <p>The published edition from which this e-text was transcribed is printed in the
               Devanāgarī script. The electronic text below is in a lossless transliteration using
               the Latin alphabet. The transliteration scheme used is the IAST (<ref
                  target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration"
                  >The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration</ref>). IAST differs in
               small ways from ISO 15919, but is preferred by most working Sanskrit scholars.
               Conversion of this file to ISO 15919 can be achieved by performing the following
               replacements throughout the file: <code> ṛ -> r̥ and ṃ -> ṁ </code>

            <normalization>

               <p>Annotations, remarks etc. by the editor of the transliteration are enclosed in
                  square brackets.</p>

               <p> Annotations by the editor(s) of the edition which served as source of the
                  transliteration (e..g. conjectures, markers for lacunae etc.) which are part of
                  the printed edition are enclosed in pointed parentheses.</p>

               <p> Colophons which are part of the printed edition are enclosed by double square

            <interpretation>

               <p>Sandhi</p>

               <p> The "principle of transliteration" has been that the input format should
                  reproduce the letters of the printed text as closely as possible, i.e., that one
                  types what one sees. However, markers are added (in the transliteration) to what
                  is printed (in Devanāgarī) to indicate that fact that a printed (and consequently
                  typed) letter has undergone some sandhi change.</p>

               <p>A sandhi change is defined with regard to the "pausa form" of a word, i..e. the
                  form a word would take at the end of a line or out of context (vigraha). Note that
                  this pausa form need not be identical with the stem which would be entered in a
                  dictionary.</p>

               <p>Thus, (final and initial) consonants which have undergone a sandhi change in the
                  text are marked by "*". Similarly, final vowels which have changed due to sandhi
                  are marked by "*" (e.g., "āsīd* rājā nalo* nāma").</p>

               <p> In case of vowel sandhi the sandhi is dissolved and marked (e.g., na*asti,
                  ca*eva). Similarly, avagraha is reconstituted, the originally omitted initial "a"
                  being marked as sandhi vowel (e.g., devo* *api).</p>

               <p> In some special cases the marking of sandhi has to be extended to include some
                  disambiguating information:</p>

               <p><list>
                     <item>-- to half--vowels which substitute for a long vowel the diacritic for
                        "long vowel" (-) is added (e.g., devy-* api);</item>

                     <item> -- if final -ā in sandhi does not stand for -āḥ (with visarga), then the
                        original vowel which has been substituted by the -ā is added (e.g., lokae*
                        eva, where "loka eva" is printed, which is the sandhi form for "loke
                        eva").</item>
                  </list></p>

               <p>In case of "double sandhi" the sandhi is marked by double "**", e.g., sa**eva in
                  case of "saiva" instead of "sa* eva").</p>

               <p>Blank is inserted between words wherever this is possible in transliteration
                  (though not necessarily in Devanāgarī), e.g., "hy* api", "nalo* *api".</p>


               <p>Compounds</p>

               <p>Another feature which exceeds what might be expected from a straightforward
                  transliteration is the separation of nominal compounds. Separation of compounds is
                  marked by inserting + between the members of a compound (e.g., brahma+purāṇa,
                  buddha+carita). In case of sandhi, the + functions also as sa.mdhi--marker, i..e.
                  no additional sandhi--marker is added (e.g., tapo+vane, mahā+ātmanaḥ).</p>

               <p>Separation of compounds is restricted to nominal compounds (including
                  upapāda--compounds like ura+ga, go+pī) and does not include grammatical analysis.
                  For details, special cases etc. see the introduction to Sanskrit Indices and Text
                  of the Brahmapurāṇa, Wiesbaden 1987, p. xvi--xvii, by P. Schreiner and R.
                  So"hnen.</p>


               <p>Variae lectiones</p>
               <p>Variants</p>
               <p>The beginning of the passage for which a variant exists is marked by opening
                  parenthesis. In deciding about the extension of the text thus marked, the changes
                  generated for the text format had to be taken into consideration. This meant that
                  occasionally words which are identical in the base text and in the variant are
                  included in the parentheses, since in the text format (sa.mhita) the beginning of
                  a variant could not be printed if that word is joined to the preceding word in
                  vowel sandhi. Thus we write "... (mahā+ātmā Xmahā+puruṣaḥ) ...", even though the
                  "mahā+" is identical in both versions.</p>

               <p>The beginning of the variant is marked by a siglum, viz. by a single capital
                  letter (capital letters are used exclusively for that purpose in the
                  transliteration). Several sigla are separated by a comma (no blank) -- which does
                  not occur in this file of course. There is no blank between the siglum and the
                  variant.</p>

               <p>If there are several variants for the same passage of the base text, they are
                  listed sequentially. The variant (or the last variant if there is more than one)
                  is closed by the closing parenthesis. The blank before the next word is considered
                  to belong to the variant and is put inside the parentheses. The continuation of
                  the base text follows without intermediate blank.</p>

               <p> Schematic pattern: <list>
                     <item>(... A... )...</item>
                     <item> (... A,B... )...</item>
                     <item> (... A... B... )...</item>
                  </list></p>


               <p>Interpolations</p>
               <p>Interpolations are treated as "variants without base text", i..e. siglum follows
                  immediately upon the opening parenthesis. The siglum is repeated before the
                  closing parenthesis which marks the end of the interpolation. This allows for the
                  input of variants within interpolations which are attested in more than one
                  source.</p>

               <p>Long interpolations may be entered as a sequence of separate interpolations (e.g.,
                  verse by verse). Interpolated lines are (may be) marked by "X" at the beginning of
                  the line (which is meant to mark "star"--passages as e.g., in the criticial
                  edition of the MBh).</p>

               <p> Omissions</p>
               <p> Passages from the base text which are omitted in any of the variant texts are
                  marked by double parentheses plus siglum enclosing the omitted passage (which may
                  also be individual words).</p>

               <p> Schematic patterns: <list>
                     <item> ((S... S))</item>
                     <item>... ((S... S))...</item>
                  </list></p>
            </interpretation>

         </editorialDecl>

         <refsDecl>
            <p>The full reference (chapter and verse) is given at the end of the verse to which it
               refers. (While transliterating the full reference needs to be typed only for the
               first verse of each chapter.) The reference consists of two figures separated by a
               (single) dot. The first number refers to the chapter, the second number refers to the
               verse--number within the chapter. </p>
            <p>The beginning of references is marked by double exclamation mark (i..e. daṇḍa) and
               the end is marked by a single exclamation mark. Always after a reference a new line
               begins.</p>
         </refsDecl>

         <p>Application information</p>

         <p>The input and processing of the transliterated text has been done with TUSTEP, the
            Tuebingen System of Text--Processing Programs.</p>

         <p>The TUSTEP format includes a reference number in front of every record; this machine
            reference has been calculated in such a way that it agrees with the textual reference.
            In the ASCII--format of the input file this machine reference is lost.</p>

         <p> Some of the tools for textual analysis which can be produced from the input format have
            been published for the Brahmapurāṇa: Peter Schreiner, Renate Soehnen: Sanskrit Indices
            and Text of the Brahmapurāṇa. Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1987.</p>

         <p>The following list gives a survey of programs (German names in parentheses) developed
            for the processing of our input: <list>
               <item>Any of the transliterated versions (i..e. ed. Johnston or ed. Cowell) can be
                  extracted (GRUNDTEXTKOP, VARTEXTKOP)</item>

               <item>The machine references in TUSTEP are calculated from the references in the text
                  (REFRECHNEN).</item>

               <item>The text format (i..e. the conventionally transliterated text without markers;
                  with compounds and sandhis reconstituted) can be generated (TEXTFORM). This
                  version can be processed for output in Devanāgarī with programs which work on the
                  basis of transliterated input (e.g., TeX).</item>

               <item>The pausa format of the text is generated by changing all the characters marked
                  by * or + according to the sandhi rules of Sanskrit grammar. Each word appears in
                  the phonetic form which it would assume at the end of a line (e.g., ādibhir*,
                  ādibhiṣ*, ādibhiś*, ādhibhis* all become ādibhiḥ). Members of compounds are
                  separated. (PAUSAFORM)</item>
