                        <p>Gentlemen at the Indology site:</p>
                        <p>I have typed out the Bhojavṛtti, the commentary on the yoga aphorisms of
                            Patañjali, the popular commentary of King Bhoja who ruled in the 11th
                            century. It is presented as a Word DOC file, which has been converted
                            into a PDF file. It is a 125-page Devanāgarī document. </p>
                        <p>The material was typed by me personally from traditional old manuscript
                            belonging to our family guru. </p>
                        <p>I have appended an English article at the end of the vṛitti and made a
                            separate section in which all the yoga sūtras are given in one
                            place.</p>
                        <p>I would like to donate this Bhojavṛitti e-text to your INDOLOGY website
                            for the general public. I have taken great care to ensure that there are
                            no mistakes in the commentary. </p>

                        <p> subject Re: Sending Commentary of King Bhoja on Yoga.</p>
                        <p>Dear Dr Dominik Wujastyk,</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your interest in my Bhojavṛtti, the Commentary by King
                            Bhoja on Patañjali's Yoga aphorisms. I have attached the material
                            hereto. The description follows.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>
                                <p>1. I am a retired professor from Zakir Husain College, Delhi
                                    University. Around the mid-fifties, when I was a young boy, the
                                    guru of my father visited our house in Calcutta for a month. He
                                    carried a palm-leaf manuscript of this Bhojavṛtti in the
                                    Devanāgarī script, which must have been very old. He reluctantly
                                    allowed me to copy it out in my notebooks, which I did in a
                                    week. He had it checked through a friend of my father. The notes
                                    remained there for 40 years, until I rediscovered them in 1995.
                                    The pages had become yellowish and brittle with age, and were in
                                    bad handwriting, because I am a Bengali and Hindi script was
                                    forieign to me those days.</p>
                                <p>In the course of 15 years, I typed out the handwritten pages and
                                    compared the material with materials in libraries in Delhi. I
                                    found many alternative expressions, some justifiable, some not.
                                    I noted down those which could be accepted. You will find them
                                    in my vṛttis inserted in square brackets with pa0, meaning
                                    pāṭhāntara. Even in some sūtras there are different readings,
                                    which I have pointed out there.</p>
                            </item>
                            <item>
                                <p>2. That my material is genuinely old can be seen from the fact
                                    that this text does not contain any European punctuation marks
                                    -- there are no commas, semicolons, quotation marks, etc. The
                                    whole vṛtti is written using only single and double vertical
                                    strokes for punctuation. Besides, joining different words
                                    together with the rules of sandhi is compulsorily done. Long
                                    continuous expressions abound, with compounds mixed with
                                    joinings, as is the case with classical commentaries. I feel
                                    that modern-day punctuation marks should not be introduced in
                                    the text, because putting hyphens may obstruct the other
                                    meanings inherent in the text. </p>
                            </item>

                                        <p>(1) Bhojavṛtti in Devanagari.doc. -- This is the main
                                            text, written in the Devanāgarī font callted Sanskrit
                                            2003. This powerful font was created by Swami
                                            Satchidananda of Omkarananda Ashram, Haridwar, India
                                            (www.omkarananda-ashram.org), in collaboration with
                                            Ulrich Stiehl, Heidelberg (www.sanskritweb.net). Ulrich
                                            had earlier tabulated all the consonant conjuncts
                                            actually seen in the religious and philosophical works
                                            of the classical and vedic language. The respected
                                            Swami-ji has included all these conjuncts in his font.
                                            (In fact he is better known for his Itranslator, which
                                            includes Sanskrit 2003 an the default font.) I have
                                            included the Sanskrit 2003 font into my zipped file. </p>
                                        <p>Ulrich has written a long technical manual on how to use
                                            this Itranslator. -- At the end of this DOC file you can
                                            find my English article titled "On the Yoga of Patanjali
                                            and King Bhoja." This article reveals to the uninitiated
                                            the secrets of spiritual practices like the Yoga through
                                            which man can break out of the horrible vortex of
                                            transmigration and return to his original
                                            fully-conscious state, never to be entangled again in
                                            the material body.</p>

                        <p>Dear Dr. Dominik Wujastyk,</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. In India when we donate something, -- the exact word is daana,
                                --- we lose all rights to it. The Bhojavṛtti I sent to you is your
                                property now, and you will use it as you please. </item>
                            <item>2. In India, the tradition is that, at some time in our life, we
                                become initiated to the sprirituality through a spiritual master
                                (guru). The best gurus are mendicant sannyāsīs, who are constantly
                                moving on foot, staying at a town not more than three months. They
                                usually avoid contact with society and stay at temples, etc. They do
                                not have any address, but through his disciples scattered all over
                                India some rumour would float that he left Pune last month and his
                                whereabouts are now not known. In 1955, when I was a 15-year-old
                                boy, this much I knew: that the manuscript this Hindi-speaking sādhu
                                was carrying was something valuable. Sanskrit was taught at my
                                school and my Sanskrit Paṇḍit told me that it would be better if I
                                could keep a copy of it. The matter was in 4 volumes, each with two
                                wooden covers and two holes to bind them together. He was possibly
                                carrying it from one Gurukul (Traditional Vedic School) to another.
                                That was why HE WAS RELUCTANT to allow me to touch it because I was
                                then ignorant of the subject. Such gurus give up even their names,
                                and assume a name ending with -ānanda (bliss). They are known by the
                                succession of disciples, and people refer to them as a disciple of
                                so and so. Later, I came to Delhi for higher studies and started
                                teaching in Delhi University. I had my own guru, who is no more in
                                the body. These days such gurus are rare. They did not have any
                                property or address, walked barefoot constantly, suddenly appearing
                                where big congregations or yajñas were held, giving initiation
                                (dīkṣā) to a few unknown people, and travelling in the company of a
                                few recluse disciples. They did not have any worry for procuring
                                food. In the afternoon they would come down to the locality where
                                people would give them alms in rice, āṭā (wheat powder) and potato.
                                They would go back to their shelter, cook it with wooden fire and
                                take a few morsels without salt. Even these days millions of such
                                sādhus exist but they do not come to the locality any more. ---
                                Instead a modern sort of religious people have emerged, who are
                                making money for their speeches, have built big Ashrams and are
                                imparting wrong information. Yoga has become some sort of physical
                                exercises.</item>
                            <item>3. My origianal typing was in ITRANS in Swami Satchidananda's
                                Itranslator. Para by para I converted the matter in transliteration
                                and Devanāgarī through his software. I am sending my ITRANS code
                                with this letter.</item>
